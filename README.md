# My Professional Data Stack
This is my professional portfolio for data analysis/engineering and software development. The tools found in Tek directory are for the metrology wing of Tektronix. These are non-live iterations of the tools & they contain absolutely no confidential information or any access to internal tools. 

So, if you need a code snippet or two out of here for your own project, go nuts! It's MIT Licensed for a reason. If you need to build similar tools and you're having a hard time, reach out, let's compare notes!

## Definition & Acronyms:
 - Metrology: the science and study of measurement; as opposed to meteorology, of which I am a hobbyist.
 - SC: "Standards Compliance"; is the asset in cal or not? If not, is it less than 30 days overdue?
 - IC: "Intermediate Checks"; a 17025-required spot check, half way through the assets' cal cycle.
 - OOTs: "Out of Tolerance"; Tek-owned standards that did not pass calibration require analysis for potential customer impact (see Impact Analysis Template.xlsm)
 - 17025: Like ISO:9001, it's another standard by which calibrations are held to and audited. Latest edition is 17025:2017.

## Impact Analysis Template.xlsm
Authored and maintained the North American standard tool for OOT Impact Analysis at Tek. VBA- and Formula-powered sheet analyzes potential customer impact of OOT standards, for the purpose of warranty recall recalibration. Written in 2018 and solely maintained since. Current Revision inside the document.

## Standards Compliance KPIs.pbix
SC Dashboard pulling directly from an internal MS Dynamics tool for our calibration management software.
